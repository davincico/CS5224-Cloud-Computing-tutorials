Pros of kube
1. Service discovery - expose containers via unique IP or dns names
2. Load balancing
3. Storage orchestration - attach storage systems of choice
4. Automated rollouts and rollbacks of application versions
5. Automatic Bin packing - optimizes container placement on nodes for efficient resource utilization
6. Self healing - auto restarts failed containers, substitues
